        <p>Visualize Chess I is the first in a series of apps that will help you to visualize the chessboard and pieces in your mind’s eye.</p>  

        <p>This first app is based on the idea of flashcards to help you learn the color of each of the 64 squares on the board. </p>  

        <p>Rather than jump right into trying to memorize all 64 squares, we’ll start easy with just the first four squares on the lower lefthand side of the board.</p>  

        <p>Notice that this pattern of squares is easy to visualize, and that is the key to this app… the point is not to memorize that g6 is a light square, but to be able to see g6 in your mind and the squares around it. </p> 

        <p>The app’s 19 levels progressively add more squares in a methodical way to enforce the simple and easy to visualize patterns learned in previous levels.</p>  

        <p>The final level is the full board, which won’t be so daunting once you’ve progressed through the earlier levels. </p> 

        <p>There are three timed tests along the way to measure your progress.</p>
